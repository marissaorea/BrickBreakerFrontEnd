# Brick Breaker Game

Play by using the paddle in order to keep the ball in the game & hit the bricks. The goal is to remove all the breakable bricks by hitting them with the ball. Some bricks need more than a single hit. If the paddle misses the ball, Game Over. If you win, your score will be tracked via the leaderboard on the right.

## Technology Stack

Written in vanilla Javascript, with a rails API backend for users endpoint to keep track of scores. This app also uses HTML canvas to code the physics of the ball movement within the canvas params.
